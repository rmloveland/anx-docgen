Using `anx-process-object', create a hash table with all of the most
current names from the /meta call.

In the new `Working with Existing Documentation' code section, build
up a hash table from the lines of text in each existing wiki table.

Loop over the first hash, checking if it already exists in the
second. If not, insert a line into the new documentation table being
built up at that point. If it does already exist, just poke that
existing line into the new table in the right place.

Dude! Sweet!
